# DigitalClockWithAlarm
This was our semester project for the course "Digital Logic Design". We built a digital clock on breadboards while we first designed the entire  
circuit in Proteus. We used readily available logic gate ICs, timer ICs like the 555 and counter ICs. The details of the required hardware are given below:

# Components Required:
1x 555 Timer IC  
21x 4026 Counter ICs  
12x 7485 Comparator ICs  
13x Push Buttons  
1x Simple ON/OFF Switch  
21x 7-Segment LEDs(Common Cathode)  
15x 2-Input AND Gates  
4x 5-Input AND Gates  
3x Capacitor  
2x Diodes  
1x Buzzer(For Alarm, in the proteus schematic, we have replaced the buzzer with an LED.)  
173x 470Ohm Resistors  
1x NOR Gate   
5x NOT Gate    
3x NPN Transistors  
2x 5-Input OR Gate  
1x 1k TrimPot  
1x 9V Voltage Source  

# How to do all this?
This is a very large project and it is as hectic as you can imagine. So look into the shecmatic where each module separately shown.  
Also since each module is independent of eachother, you can simply build the parts you want to build rather than building this whole thing.  
Just look at the Sections below and decide which ones you want to implement. I have also included an SVG file if you don't like the clumsiness of proteus's own spanning around the circuit.
