# DigitalClockWithAlarm
This is a hardware implementation of a basic digital clock using logic gates and some counter ICs and a clock generator.
In the video demonstration, you might get confused with the last part because there is no buzzer. We lost the buzzer at the last possible moment so we used an LED(visible on the left side) as the alarm.
